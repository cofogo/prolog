- Implement following external settings via a config file:
    - Duration of day for calculation (e.g. 24h vs 8h)
	- Toggle if hours should be translated into days at all.
- Implement the ability to log several projects, via defining and selecting filenames and directories.
- Improve the text editor. Should probably overhaul the entire text editing system and memory operations.
